# Getting Started with Astro

Astro is a modern static site builder that offers an innovative approach to web development. It allows you to use your favorite JavaScript frameworks while delivering lightning-fast performance through its partial hydration system.

## Why Choose Astro?

1. **Performance First**: Astro automatically removes unnecessary JavaScript from your site, making it incredibly fast by default.

2. **Framework Agnostic**: Use React, Vue, Svelte, or any other framework you prefer - Astro works with all of them.

3. **Component Islands**: Astro's partial hydration system lets you keep interactive components while maintaining static site benefits.

## Getting Started

To create your first Astro project, run:

```bash
npm create astro@latest
```

This will set up a new Astro project with all the basic configurations you need to get started.
